<a name="q5"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">What should I do if my product arrives damaged?</span><br>
<strong><u>ALL ORDERS SHOULD ALWAYS BE INSPECTED PRIOR TO ACCEPTANCE!</u></strong><br>
In event that your order has been damaged in transit, make note on the BOL (Bill of Lading) that the driver has with him/her. <br>
<br>
If the damage is <strong>MINOR</strong> (e.g. cracked or dented covers, scratched paint, missing end caps, broken console, etc.) please make note on the BOL (Bill of Lading) and ACCEPT shipment. Once signed for, please contact your GS Customs representative so that we can replace or repair any parts issues and be reimbursed by the shipping carrier as per your BOL notes.<br>
<br>
If the damage is <strong>MAJOR</strong> (e.g. cracked frame, bent steel, fork lift punctures, or other extreme cases that would render a product unusable), you have the right to refuse delivery. Make sure to note all the outstanding issues on the carriers BOL (Bill of Lading), and call us immediately at customfitnessequipment.com, so that a customer service representative can guide you through the process of receiving a replacement unit / store credit. <br>

<a name="q6"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">What does curbside freight mean?</span><br>
Curbside freight is the standard delivery service via freight carriers, that leaves your product on the first dry landing of your home or business (e.g. driveway/front door step, or commercial store front). The trucking company will call you in advance to schedule a time of delivery. Typically, it will be scheduled during business hours Monday-Friday and they will provide you with a 2-5 hour window for delivery.<br>
<strong>PLEASE INSPECT YOUR DELIVERED ORDER FOR DAMAGES PRIOR TO ACCEPTANCE!</strong><br>
If your equipment is damaged, please read the procedure above. <br>
<a href="#top"><br>

If required, the service will also include disassembly of equipment to move through your location and reassembly of the product in the selected final location.<br/>

<a name="q10"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">How much does shipping usually cost?</span><br/>
Based on our consistent volume of daily shipments we are able to secure the most competitive rates and pass the savings on to our customers. Residential orders with lift-gate service traditionally ship from a minimum of $145 to roughly $395 depending on the dimensions, weight and final destination of the unit. Commercial orders with loading dock will ship for less than residential. Larger orders, full trailers, and ocean freight will yield a much lower unit price based on volume at roughly $100 to $175 per unit. Expedited air freight services are available at a slightly higher price point if desired.
<br/><a href="#top"><br/>

<br>
<a></a><strong>Where is my order shipping from?</strong><br>
Most orders will be shipped from one of our two New York warehouse locations. Some new equipment orders will be shipped directly from the manufacturer to your door. A GS Customs representative, at your request, will notify you of the shipment from our location and estimated delivery date. <br>

<hr/><br/>
<a name="q13"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Can I arrange my own shipping?</span><br/>
<b>Sure!</b> Although GS Customs secures some of the most competitive shipping rates, we understand that our customers sometimes have relationships with carriers. In this instance, GS Customs can provide you with the package dimensions required to get your own quote. If your quote is lower than our quote, we have no issues using your carrier; however, if any damage during transit occurs after leaving the GS Customs warehouse, you, the customer, would be responsible to contact the carrier and file any and all damage claims.

Back to top</a><br/><hr/><br/>
<a name="q14"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Is my equipment shipment insured?</span><br/>
All equipment delivered by GS Customs, or trusted freight carriers are insured for the full sale value not including shipping costs. If shipped through GS Customs's network of trusted carriers, GS Customs will supersede the damage claim and make any and all repairs at the location of the customer.
